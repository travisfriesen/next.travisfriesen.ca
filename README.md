# Personal Portfolio Website
## About

This is the 2025 updated version of my portfolio showcasing the skills that I've learned on other projects using Next.js, TailwindsCSS, and React-Icons.

A big thing that I worked on with this site is trying to setup dynamic card components for my project cards. This allows me to dynamically create both the cards showcasing the technologies and the project cards themself using a json file - [projects.json](/src/data/projects.json)

This makes is super simple to add/modify/remove projects from my website, and will potentially allow me to link it with future projects.
